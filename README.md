##DESCRIPTION:-
This project focuses on building a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate or forecast outcomes based on historical data. The process begins with importing and exploring the dataset to understand the data patterns, correlations, and feature relationships. After preprocessing the data — including cleaning, encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and normalizing features — several regression and classification algorithms are applied depending on the type of prediction required.

For continuous outcome prediction (regression), algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor are implemented to forecast target values like sales, prices, or purchase amounts. For categorical outcomes (classification), models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are used to predict discrete labels like sentiment, customer behavior, or risk categories.

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R² Score for regression, and Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score for classification tasks. Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to interpret data distributions and compare model results.

The outcome of this predictive analysis enables data-driven decision-making by identifying trends and predicting future outcomes with measurable accuracy. This project demonstrates the complete workflow of a machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and prediction — using Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
